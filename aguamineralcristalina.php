                <h2>Did you know?</h2>
                <h3>Importance of water in winter !!</h3>
                <p><b>Experts warn of water consumption in winter</b></p>
                <p>hirst sensation decreases, but liquid intake is important to prevent doenças.Chá is one of the outputs to hydrate the organism, as well as fruits.</p>
                <p>Winter does not only fall the temperature, as water consumption. However, experts warn: the sensation of thirst decreases, but the importance of fluid to the body does not. The consumption of about two liters these colder days is important to prevent renal problems, skin disorders and dehydration.</p>
                <p>The nutritionist Edna Garambone states that care should be taken with elderly and children, which dehydrate more easily.</p>
                <p>According to her, in winter, the fact that the body needs less water than in the summer, for example. Hence feel less thirsty. The problem is that people who already drink little in the heat, drink less even in the cold. It gives a recipe able not only moisturize, but warm the body in the winter chill:</p>
                <p>"If you do not want to take water, a good solution is to take tea. I suggest green tea, which is only contraindicated for people prone to gastritis or hypertension. That's because caffeine stimulates the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, "he explains.</p>
                <p>Other sources of hydration, she said, are fruits like melon, watermelon, orange and pineapple. They are richer liquid than typical winter fruit, such as avocado, apple and grape.</p>
                <p>"Soda, only if it is on a desert island and you have no other choice!", Warns nutritionist.</p>

                <p><b>Disease may worsen</b></p>
                <p>The head of the Nephrology Service of the University Hospital Clementino Fraga Filho, Alvimar Goncalves Delgado, explains that this time of year, we have a tendency to remove more water in the urine, as we sweat less than in warmer weather.</p>
                <p>"Anyone who has developed some kidney problem should pay attention this time of year to prevent these diseases from getting worse. This time of year, such cases arise when such monitoring decreases in relation to water, "says Delgado.</p>
                <p>The warning applies not only for those who have a tendency to form kidney stones or cystitis. Those suffering from recurrent urinary infections, caused by low immunity, should also keep water consumption to date, according to Delgado.</p>

                <p><b>Exaggeration should be avoided</b></p>
                <p>Sueli Carneiro, deputy head of the same hospital dermatology department, warning that water should be ingested without exaggeration.</p>
                <p>"There is a near balance between ingestion and elimination of water by the regulatory mechanisms of the body. The loss of water is regulated by the kidneys, the skin, the lungs, the digestive tract. The water should not be drunk in excess, but the quantity required to maintain a stable condition of the body in terms of temperature and pressure "explained dermatologist.</p>
                <p>According to her, it is common to increase the number of people with skin problems in clinics that time of year. Without enough water in the body, the skin tends's become more dry, affecting mostly those suffering from skin diseases, elderly and athletes who exercise outdoors activities.</p>
                <p>"This time of year is the season of dry skin. But the important thing is to know how to dispense the right amount of water to the body. The average person should consume two to four liters of fluid a day. But who have kidney problems or heart failure should be careful not to overload the kidneys or the heart, "he explains.</p>
                <p>Source: Globo.com﻿</p>

                <h3>You only take water when you're thirsty? Or dispense one cup of water because you feel embarrassed?</h3>
                <p>Know that these attitudes can harm your health. Already more than proven that water is an essential element in the human body and that no one can live without it.</p>
                <p>Experts recommend regular intake of fluids even if there is sede.70% of our body is water, it is impossible and incoherent talking about quality of life not to mention water, therefore it is essential to our health than water that ingest has a good quality and its characteristic being potencializadas.A headquarters is already considered a sign of dehydration.</p>
                <p>Studies show that during intense physical activity, a lot of liquid reserves in the body can be consumed before the individual feel thirsty. Without these reserves, the body suffers from dehydration. In addition to age, the ability to perceive the symptoms of dehydration decreases. So there's no way: even those who are not water fan should surrender its powers.</p>
                <p>On average, most adults loses about ten cups (2.4 liters) of liquid per day through sweat, breath, urine and feces. To compensate, so the logic points you need ten glasses of water a day. Although water is usually the best option, it is not the only way to reset the net losses.</p>
                <p>It is possible, for example, to obtain water from beverages and other foods. The amount of water you need each day depends on your food, sex, degree of physical activity, climate, health, age and medications used. Consult your doctor to find out the amount indicated in your case.﻿</p>
        
                <h3>You know the symptoms of dehydration?</h3>
                <p> Dehydration is a potentially serious illness that is characterized by low concentration not only water but also organic minerals and salts in the body fluids, the extent of preventing it to perform its normal functions. The disease may be secondary to acute diarrhea and affect people of all ages but is most dangerous for children (especially newborns and infants) and for the elderly.</p>
                <p><b>Causes</b></p>
                <p>Dehydration occurs if the water eliminated by the body through the breath, sweat, urine, feces and tears is not reset properly. This can happen when fluid intake is insufficient, in cases of vomiting, diarrhea and fever, in hot weather because of excessive sweating in patients with diabetes due to an increase in the number of voids and the uncontrolled use of diuretics .The dehydration can be classified according to the degree of severity as mild, moderate and severe. Are classic signs of mild to moderate dehydration exaggerated thirst, dry mouth and skin, sunken eyes, absence or small tear production, decreased sweating and, in babies, the soft spot sunk. Headache, drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, fatigue and increased heart rate may also be associated with episodes of desidratação.Além these symptoms, which are intensified with the worsening of the picture, in cases of severe dehydration, there may be others like fall blood pressure, unconsciousness, convulsions, coma, organ failure and morte.DiagnósticoO diagnosis of dehydration is based mainly on clinical judgment, but you may need to perform some simple blood tests, stool and urine tests to identify the cause and the severity of the disease.</p>
                <p><b>Treatment</b></p>
                <p>Breast milk is the ideal resource for the treatment of dehydration in the first six months of a child's life. Then, regardless of age, in cases of mild to moderate dehydration, drink plenty of filtered or boiled water in small sips and short breaks can be enough to rehydrate the body. It is important to keep the person in an environment with mild temperatures to prevent water loss by suor.Nos cases of severe dehydration, which can occur from a sudden, rehydration should be done with oral serum distributed free in health centers and available in pharmacies. This serum can be prepared at home and is valid for 24 hours after diluted in water.If is difficult to get the serum for rehydration in health care, it is possible to prepare the ORS, in the following proportions: 1 liter of filtered water or boiled, one level teaspoon salt tea and two level spoons of sugar.</p>
                <p><b>Recommendations</b></p>
                <p>* Drink plenty of fluids, at least two liters a day; <br>
                * Make sure children and the elderly are taking the amount of liquid needed to maintain good hydration of the body. In these age groups, often they forget to do so;
                * Use light clothing and avoid direct exposure to the sun on hot days; <br>
                * Do not practice physical exercises in the hottest hours of the day; <br>
                * Wash your hands before meals and after using the bathroom; <br>
                * Make sure that the foods that will be eaten raw have been properly prepared.</p>

                <h3>Water is the source of life</h3>
                <p>No matter who we are, what we do, where we live, we depend on it to live. Yet, however great the importance of water, people continue polluting the rivers and its sources, forgetting how much it is essential to our lives.
                <p>Water is probably the only natural resource that has to do with all aspects of human civilization, from the agricultural and industrial development to the cultural values ​​and religious rooted in society. It is an essential natural resource, whether as a biochemical component of living beings as a way of life for many plant and animal species as a representative element of social and cultural values ​​and even as a factor of production of various goods to the end and intermediate consumption.
                <p>According to statistics, 70% of the planet consists of water, and only 3% is fresh water and of this total, 98% is groundwater. This means that most available and safe water is minimal near the total amount of water in our earth. In modern societies, the pursuit of comfort necessarily imply a considerable increase in daily water needs.</p>
                <p>Water resources have profound importance in the development of various economic activities. In relation to agricultural production, water may represent up to 90% of the physical composition of plants. The lack of water in the plant growth periods can destroy crops and to properly deployed ecosystems. In the industry, to obtain various products, the necessary quantities of water are often higher than the volume produced.</p>
                <p>Looking at the data below, we realize that we need to start to use water prudently and rationally, avoiding waste and pollution because:</p>
                <p>- A sixth of the world population, more than one billion people lack access to safe drinking water;</p>
                <p>- 40% of the world population (2,400 million) lack access to basic sanitation services;</p>
                <p>- About 6000 children die every day from diseases related to unsafe water and poor sanitation and hygiene one;</p>
                <p>- According to the UN, by 2025 if current consumption patterns continue, two out of three people worldwide will suffer moderate or severe water shortages.</p>
                <p>Brazil is a privileged country with regard to the amount of water. Has the largest freshwater reserves on Earth, ie 12% of the world total. Its distribution, however, is not uniform across the country. The Amazon, for example, is a region that has the largest river basin in the world. The volume of water of the Amazon River is the largest in the world, being considered an essential river for the planet. At the same time, it is also one of the least populated regions of Brazil.</p>
                <p>In contrast, the largest population concentrations in the country are in the capital, far from the large Brazilian rivers like the Amazon, the São Francisco and the Paraná. The biggest shortage problem is still in the Northeast, where the lack of water for long periods has contributed to the abandonment of the land and migration to urban centers such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, further aggravating the problem of water scarcity these cities.</p>
                <p>In addition, the Brazilian rivers and lakes have been committed by the quality of falling water available for abstraction and treatment. In the Amazon and in the Pantanal, for example, rivers like the Madeira, the Cuiabá and Paraguay already have mercury contamination, metal used in underground mining, and the use of pesticides in crop fields. In large cities, this commitment of quality is caused by discharges of domestic and industrial waste water, and the use of rivers as convenient carriers of waste.﻿</p>

                <p>According to some scholars intake continuously mineral water LITINADA, helps in recovery of muscle tiredness, fatigue, stress and depression. In addition to the lithium be a great ally in the recovery of addiction, help in the clearance of uric acid.</p>
                <p>Lithium is a mineral element found in rocks and in some mineral waters, from which it is extracted, industrialized is used for treatment of various diseases related to the central nervous system.﻿</p>

                <h3>Sodium is a vital component for the body?</h3>
                <p>Sodium is essential for the maintenance of several physiological functions of the organism:</p>
                <p>Nerve transmission, muscle contraction, blood pressure maintenance and balances fluid and acid-base as well as being important for the transport of many nutrients in the small intestine and kidneys.﻿</p>

                <h3>Sodium is bad for health?</h3>
                <p>No, on the contrary, it is necessary for the proper functioning of the body, provided it is consumed in adequate amounts. According Anvisa, the recommended daily intake is up to 2.400mg sodium per day.</p>
                <p>A bottle of 500ml = 64,3mg / l or 0,064g (owned only 2% of the value of Diaro recommended)</p>
                <p>It would be necessary to drink 38 bottles of Mineral Water Crystalline daily to achieve the daily recommended amount of sodium.﻿</p>

                    <h4>How much water needed?</h4>
                    <div class="imgdireita"><img src="img/agua.jpg" alt=""></div>
                <p>Who has not heard that we need to take at least 2 liters of water a day for the body to function well?</p>
                <p>But is this is the appropriate amount for all individuals?</p>
                <p>How to know how much water should we drink a day?</p>
                <p>In fact, the amount of water to be consumed depends on a number of factors ranging from the amount of exercise performed to room temperature where estamos.A following describes some of the factors which influence and determine the amount of water that must drink daily:</p>
                <p>** Level of physical activity: Who is everyday needs more water than someone who does three times a week hiking. Therefore, the more intense physical activity performed, the greater the amount of water required. It is also important to drink water during and after physical activity.</p>
                <p>** Climate: Who lives in hot cities, needs more water than those who live in colder places. We also need more water in summer when sweat more and thus lose more water than in winter.</p>
                <p>** Metabolism: Who has a higher metabolism needs more water than those with slower metabolism.</p>
                <p>** Weight: 100kg A person needs more water than a 50 kilograms. The greater the weight, the greater the need of water.</p>
                <p>** Diet: If you eat too much salt, will need more water than those who eat more fruits and vegetables, which are rich in water.</p>
                <p>** General condition: Some physical conditions interfere with the need of water. If you have fever, for example, should increase fluid intake. The same tip applies to those who have episodes of diarrhea or vomiting. To replace lost fluid, opt for broths and soups instead of sugary liquids. Some diseases such as renal failure, for example, require limiting the amount of water intake.</p>
                <p>** Drinking: If you drink alcohol, try alternating alcoholic drinks with water. The trick is to have a glass of water after every drink, since alcohol helps dehydrate the body. For the avoidance of doubt, note how often you urinate and the color of your urine. Ideally, it is amarelo-clara.Se urine is dark yellow with a strong odor and you are going less often than usual to the bathroom, it is a sign that you are eating little water. Take two cups of water to hydrate.</p>

                <p>There is no way to live without water. It represents 40% to 80% of the total weight of the human being, and vital organ functions depend on it to be fully realized.</p>
                <p>To supply all the body's needs must be taken on average two liters of water every day. The nutritionist Camila Leonel da Paulista School of Medicine, Unifesp (Federal University of São Paulo) explains that, over 24 hours, we lost about two liters of water through perspiration, urine, breath and other activities that maintain vital functions. "The body does not have any reservations or conditions for water storage. It is essential that your spare is daily to maintain health and basic body functions. In household measures, that amount is eight glasses ".</p>
                <p>"What often happens is that many people expect to have thirsty to drink water. Thirst is a warning signal to the body's need for water. It appears when the amount of fluid in the body is already below the desired level. So do not wait to get thirsty and your body go with the levels of águana reservation. Replenish your body frequently, "emphasizes Leonel.</p>
                <p>Dehydrated individuals have less blood volume than normal, which ends up hindering the functioning of the heart. The lack of water can cause weakness, dizziness, headache, fatigue, and if it is too long, lead to death.</p>
                <p>One tip is: always have a bottle of water at hand, for fluid replacement should be frequent and independent of sense of thirst. Also, if two liters of water seem too, know that part of the daily intake can be supplied to other sources, such as juices, coconut water, milk, fruit, teas and soups.</p>
                <p>If these details have not yet convinced about the importance of rigorously drink the required amount of water a day, here are five other benefits of water:</p>
                <p>* It regulates body temperature - During the exercise or when the weather is too hot, the water is released from the body by sweating to regulate temperature and prevent our body too warm or suffer rapid temperature changes.</p>
                <p>* Detoxifies the body - It assists in the prevention and treatment of urinary infection because the liquid stimulates trips to the bathroom, which helps to "clean up" the urinary tract. In partnership with the action of dietary fiber, water helps to form and hydrate the stool, preventing it from drying and, consequently, cause constipation. It also assists in respiration, it dilutes the mucous, facilitating the expectoration of pulmonary residues.</p>
                <p>* Absorption and Transport of nutrients - Water aids in absorption of nutrients and glucose. In addition, the fluid helps in the transport of these substances by the blood stream and distribution to various parts of the body.</p>
                <p>* Slimming - In addition to reducing water retention because it puts the kidneys to work, water also brings feeling of satiety. So drink two or three glasses before a meal helps control appetite. Not to mention that has no calories.</p>
