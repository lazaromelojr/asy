                <h3>PARTNERSHIP TO INSTALL A PLANT IN USA</h3>
                <p>Nipoamerican has the firm intention to expand their business in the USA, a market that is growing for their products manufactured in Brazil.</p>
                <p>The production has to be expanded to attend this demand. Nipoamerican had the options to expand the Brazilian plant or to install a brand new one in USA. The company has decided to install a new plant directly in the USA.</p>
                <p>The main reasons are the elimination of international ocean freight, the growing availability of working capital and lower interest rates in  USA; the reduction in delivery times of products in stores, due to the elimination of international travel, improving technical assistance and guarantee to North American consumers.</p>
                <p>To reach this objective, the company would rather to find a North American associated with previous experience in this business.</p>

                <p>Ordinary mattresses in the market are too hard (orthopedic) or sink at waistline level with extended use (regular foam and springs) and do not respect the body's natural weight distribution, making you toss and turn more than necessary thus compromising your night's rest. </p>
                <h4><b>SLEEP BETTER! </b></h4>
                <p>The Interactive Oriental J2000 was scientifically developed to offer its user HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE through proper rest. Its layers allow for weight to be distributed correctly throughout the mattress surface and aid in the ALIGNMENT of the vertebrae. The result is a NIGHT'S REST that is both calm and pain-free. </p>
                <p>We are PIONEERS in the field of preventive health care technology in mattresses, we are in the market since 1989 and we are the only company in this sector to obtain a patent for the use of its products.  </p>

                <p>Conducted Research (Conventional Mattresses) </p>
                 <div class="imgdireita"><img src="img/j2000_09.png" alt=""></div>
                <p>Research conducted with conventional mattresses proved important facts. A piece of equipment working in conjunction with a matt containing micro points of weight exposure and a sophisticated computer program determined high pressure points from everyday mattresses on the human body. </p>
                <p>Various mattresses were tested by the "Postural Biomedicine Group of Italy/USA." With this test, it was proven that these mattresses do not maintain ideal body posture during rest because they compress the muscles against the bones and joints. In reality, it proved that the greater the pressure point areas, the bigger is the possibility of localized pain in various parts of the body. This increases postural alterations of the vertebrae, causing pain or greater issues such as a herniated disk, scoliosis and kyphosis, among others. </p>
                <h5><b>Research Conducted (Oriental J2000) Unique Density</b></h5>
                <p>Traditional mattresses distribute weight unevenly, creating pain-inducing pressure points which causes user to toss and turn more than necessary during rest. You will be able to sleep better, according to your body's needs because the Oriental J2000, through research, developed a product that allows a single mattress to be able to serve various physical biotypes. You will be able to sleep and awaken refreshed, free of body aches with the UNIQUE PROGRESSIVE DENSITY. </p>
