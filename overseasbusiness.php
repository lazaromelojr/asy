This enables us to develop our own know-how, obtained through this long standing partnership with the CBI - such know-how recently rooted with the fundamentals of the ITC program.<br />                    <br />                    From this knowledge, we began preparing Brazilian companies and entrepreneurs interested in expanding abroad, may it be in investments, foreign capital, technology transference, financing, partnerships and joint-ventures in general, using for such the opportunities offered by the GB&M (Global Business & Markets) ─ <a href="http://www.hannovermesse.de/home">www.hannovermesse.de</a> => Exhibition => Global Business and Markets ─, which take place inside the Hanover Fair environment, in Germany, yearly in April.<br />                    <br />                </div>            </div><!-- FIM COLUNA -->                    </div><!-- FIM ROW CLEARFIX -->                        <div class="row clearfix">                        <div class="col-md-12 column">				<div id="gallery" align="center">					<ul>                       						<li>                        	<a href="img/1.jpg" title="">							<img src="img/1.jpg" width="180" height="113" alt="" />							</a>                        </li>                        <li>                        	<a href="img/2.jpg" title="">							<img src="img/2.jpg" width="180" height="113" alt="" />							</a>                        </li>                        <li>                        	<a href="img/3.jpg" title="">							<img src="img/3.jpg" width="180" height="113" alt="" />							</a>                        </li>                         <li>                        	<a href="img/4.jpg" title="">							<img src="img/4.jpg" width="180" height="113" alt="" />							</a>                        </li>                                            </ul>                    				</div>			</div><!-- FIM COLUNA -->                    </div><!-- FIM ROW CLEARFIX -->                                <div class="row clearfix">                        <div class="col-md-12 column">                <div class="texto">                    <strong>Our services have three basic steps:</strong><br />                    <br />                    <strong>1ª</strong> − Brazilian's company preparation to adequate itself to the international business' rules, including its presentation dossier containing the Business Plan, Feasibility Analysis and, whenever necessary, the Company's Evaluation.
