                <h1 class="textoLaranja">Pirosol / Pyrozzar</h1>

                <p>45 years ago a young graduate student in college, along with a group of friends, decides to invest in the business itself. From the door-to-door sale of detergents to the dream of owning his own business, he hardly knew that a pioneer company in paint recycling would be born there and a leader in its market. Founded in May 1973 in Salto, a town in Sao Paulo, Brazil, initially as a factory of fuses and lamps, it was in 1974 that Mr. Francisco Araújo believed in new ideas and, from the departure of his partners, decided to innovate and recycle paints, in the old field of the avenue, also in Salto.</p>
                <div class="imgdireita"><img src="img/banner-pyr.png" alt=""></div>
                 <p>Such an initiative began to take shape. As there was no Quality Control, the machinery was precarious and suffered several damages due to flooding of the Tiete River, Mr. Francisco acquired a larger area where the company is today, ratifying the company's objective: to avoid waste and solvents to stop in nature , recycle and produce quality products.</p>

                 <p>Today the company is a Brazilian leader in the recycling of paints, varnishes and solvents. Recycling these products keeps them from spreading in the environment and helping to reduce the pollution in the world.</p>

                 <p>The importance of investing in the reuse of these materials is also explained by the fact that this reduces costs for industries that previously had no way of getting rid of waste.</p>
                 
                 <p>Pirosol Pyrozzar has a working method based on trust and respect. It provides the customer with a safe, environmentally sound product that complies with environmental laws and regulations. With the growth in the business, in 1988 was created Pirosol, sister company responsible for industrial distillation.</p>
                <div class="imgesquerda"><img src="img/banner-pyrozzar-4.png" alt=""></div>
                 <p>The relationship with the customer is a key point for the company. Currently, there are more than 3,000 active clients, in all Brazilian States and in Countries such as Chile, Argentina and Paraguay. 60 employees are part of the Pirosol Pyrozzar team as well as representatives and subcontractors.</p>

                 <p>A company that has been interested since the beginning in preserving the environment, and because of this motivation, cares so much about investing in its products, employees and especially in the future, it maintains constant training for all its employees and expansion projects that aim to serve all of Latin America with its products.</p>
                 <br>
                 <h3>The ideal solution for your company waste</h3>
                 <p>A suggestion for the reuse of contaminated paint lees and solvents in the industries, decreasing with the destination cost and favoring the preservation of the environment.</p> 
                
                <p>Dyes and solvents are industrial wastes characterized according to NBR 10004 as waste CLASS I - HAZARDOUS AND NON-INERT RESIDUES, as they have characteristics of toxicity and dangerousness that present risks to public health and to the environment – vegetable and animal world, besides making it unfeasible their disposal in landfills, causing problems with inadequate storage. It proposes the recovery of this waste, transforming it into raw materials for paints and solvents, minimizing the environmental impact they could cause. Provides the safety of environmentally sound, compliance with environmental laws and regulations.</p>
