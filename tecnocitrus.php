                <h3>STARTING</h3>
                <p>TECNOCITRUS started its citrus processing activities in 2014 with the responsibility of building a good name in an increasingly demanding national / international market.

TECNOCITRUS is eminently an exporter of orange juice, through ASY Trading LLC, besides being an important supplier of orange peel to one of the largest citrus pectin industries in the world located in Brazil. Also, it manufactures in its unit in Conchal, distilled oil and citric terpene. TECNOCITRUS can be used for the production of candies, confectionery and sweets, in addition to - in the case of terpene - be used with important raw material for some biodegradable products used as degreasers. They are also known for not harming the environment and therefore their demand has been on the rise worldwide.</p>
